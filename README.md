# Querying-on-OpenAlex-Data-in-Streaming-Fashion
---
- OpenAlex is an index of hundreds of millions of interconnected entities across the global research system. A major part of any research is exploring and surveying various research papers, publications, and articles. An ability to query and fetch the specific information reliably and explore different research topics in general can be valuable. This project aims at efficiently fetching this required information in the form of database queries in a streaming fashion. We aim to analyze the collection of research works to find most prominent papers and authors ranging across multiple research fields.
## Objective:
Our Project aims to answer the following questions:
- What were the most prominent papers (with respect to citation count) in a particular topic such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc.?
- Which authors were most actively involved in publishing new works and how their work impacted forthcoming publications (based on how many future works referenced an authorâ€™s works)?
- Which are some quickly growing research areas in the recent years (quantified by accelerated increase in number of publications in the recent years)?
- Distribution of publications over time. Is there a seasonality to the number of works published throughout the year? (Eg. Are the publications concentrated around a particular time of the year?
