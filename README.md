# Querying-on-OpenAlex-Data-in-Streaming-Fashion
---
- OpenAlex is an index of hundreds of millions of interconnected entities across the global research system. A major part of any research is exploring and surveying various research papers, publications, and articles. An ability to query and fetch the specific information reliably and explore different research topics in general can be valuable. This project aims at efficiently fetching this required information in the form of database queries in a streaming fashion. We aim to analyze the collection of research works to find most prominent papers and authors ranging across multiple research fields.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20269969/200132902-e5c39ab6-289e-4d3f-a449-4c4e7a534637.png)
